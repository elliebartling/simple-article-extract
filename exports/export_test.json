Over three decades, the dashing criminal robbed a hundred banks, escaped three prisons, and made off with millions. Today, he is best known for Sutton\u2019s Law: Asked by a reporter why he robbed banks, Sutton allegedly quipped, \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\n\nSutton\u2019s Law explains something unusual about Bernie Sander\u2019s tax plan: it calls for massive tax hikes across the board. Why raise taxes on the middle class? Because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nThe problem all politicians face is that voters love to get stuff, but they hate to pay for it. The traditional solution that center-left politicians pitch is the idea that the poor and middle class will get the benefits, and the rich will pay for it.\n\nThis is approximately how things work in the United States. The top 1 percent of taxpayers earn 19 percent of total income and pay 38 percent of federal income taxes. The bottom 50 percent earn 12 percent and pay 3 percent. This chart from the Heritage Foundation shows net taxes paid and benefits received, per person, by household income group:\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 proposals (free college, free health care, jobs programs, more Social Security, etc.) are way too heavy for the rich alone to carry, and he knows it. To his credit, his campaign has released a plan to pay for each of these myriad handouts. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews has totaled up all the tax increases Sanders has proposed so far, and the picture is simply staggering.\n\nEvery household earning below $250,000 will face a tax hike of nearly 9 percent. Past that, rates explode, up to a top rate of 77 percent on incomes over $10 million.\n\nPaying for Free\n\nSanders argues that most people\u2019s average income tax rate won\u2019t change, but this is only true if you exclude the two major taxes meant to pay for his health care program: a 2.2 percent \u201cpremium\u201d tax and 6.2 percent payroll tax, imposed on incomes across the board. These taxes account for majority of the new revenue Sanders is counting on.\n\nBut it gets worse: his single-payer health care plan will cost 80 percent more than he claims. Analysis by the left-leaning scholar Kenneth Thorpe (who supports single payer) concludes that Sanders\u2019 proposal will cost $1.1 trillion more each year than he claims. The trillion dollar discrepancy results from some questionable assumptions in Sanders\u2019 numbers. For instance:\n\nSanders assumes $324 billion more per year in prescription drug savings than Thorpe does. Thorpe argues that this is wildly implausible. \u201cIn 2014 private health plans paid a TOTAL of $132 billion on prescription drugs and nationally we spent $305 billion,\u201d he writes in an email. \u201cWith their savings drug spending nationally would be negative.\u201d\n\nSo unless pharmaceutical companies start paying you to take their drugs, the Sanders administration will need to increase taxes even more.\n\nAnalysis by the Tax Foundation finds that his proposed tax hikes already total $13.6 trillion over the next ten years. However, \u201cthe plan would [only] end up collecting $9.8 trillion over the next decade when accounting for decreased economic output.\u201d\n\nAnd the consequences will be truly devastating. Because of the taxes on labor and capital, GDP will be reduced 9.5 percent. Six million jobs will be lost. On average, after-tax incomes will be reduced by more than 18 percent.\n\nIncomes for the bottom 50 percent will be reduced by more than 14 percent, and incomes for the top 1 percent will be reduced nearly 25 percent. Inequality warriors might cheer, but if you want to actually raise revenue, crushing the incomes of the people who pay almost 40 percent of all taxes isn\u2019t the way to go.\n\nThese are just the effects of the $1 trillion tax hike he has planned \u2014 and he probably needs to double that to pay for single payer. Where will he find it? He\u2019ll go where European welfare states go.\n\nBeing Like Scandinavia\n\nSanders is a great admirer of Scandinavian countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and many of his proposals are modeled on their systems. But to pay for their generous welfare benefits, they tax, and tax, and tax.\n\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden all capture between 20-26 percent of GDP from income and payroll taxes. By contrast, the United States collects only 15 percent.\n\nScandinavia\u2019s tax rates themselves are not that much higher than the United States\u2019. Denmark\u2019s top rate is 30 percent higher, Sweden\u2019s is 18 percent higher, and Norway\u2019s is actually 16 percent lower \u2014 and yet Norway\u2019s income tax raises 30 percent more revenue than the United States.\n\nThe answer lies in how progressive the US tax system is, in the thresholds at which people are hit by the top tax rates. The Tax Foundation explains,\n\nScandinavian income taxes raise a lot of revenue because they are actually rather flat. In other words, they tax most people at these high rates, not just high-income taxpayers. The top marginal tax rate of 60 percent in Denmark applies to all income over 1.2 times the average income in Denmark. From the American perspective, this means that all income over $60,000 (1.2 times the average income of about $50,000 in the United States) would be taxed at 60 percent. \u2026 Compare this to the United States. The top marginal tax rate of 46.8 percent (state average and federal combined rates) kicks in at 8.5 times the average U.S. income (around $400,000). Comparatively, few taxpayers in the United States face the top marginal rate.\n\nThe reason European states can pay for giant welfare programs is not because they just tax the rich more \u2014 it\u2019s because they also scoop up a ton of middle class income. The reason why the United States can't right now is its long-standing political arrangement to keep taxes high on the rich so they can be low on the poor and middle.\n\nWhere the Money Is \u2013 And Isn\u2019t\n\nAs shown by the Laffer Curve, there is a point at which increasing tax rates actually reduces tax revenue, by discouraging work, hurting the economy, and encouraging tax avoidance.\n\nBernie\u2019s plan already hammers the rich: households earning over $250,000 (the top 3 percent) would face marginal rates of 62-77 percent \u2014 meaning the IRS would take two-thirds to three-quarters of each additional dollar earned. His proposed capital gains taxes are so high that they are likely well past the point of positive returns. The US corporate tax rate of 40 percent is already the highest in the world, and even Sanders hasn\u2019t proposed increasing it.\n\nThe only way to solve his revenue problem is to raise rates on the middle and upper-middle classes, or flatten the structure to make the top rates start kicking in much lower. You can see why a \u201cprogressive\u201d isn\u2019t keen on making more regressive taxes part of his platform, but the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nThe bottom fifty percent don\u2019t pay much income tax now (only $34 billion), but they also don\u2019t earn enough to fill the gap. Making their taxes proportionate to income would only raise $107 billion, without even considering how the higher rates would reduce employment and income.\n\nThe top 5 percent are pretty well wrung dry by Sanders\u2019 plan, and their incomes are going to be reduced by 20-25 percent anyway. It\u2019s hard to imagine that there\u2019s much more blood to be had from that stone.\n\nBut households between the 50th and the 95th percentile (incomes between $37,000 to $180,000 a year) earn about 54 percent of total income \u2014 a share would likely go up, given the larger income reductions expected for top earners. Currently, this group pays only 38 percent of total income taxes, and, despite the 9 percent tax hike, they\u2019re comparatively spared by the original tax plan. Their incomes are now the lowest hanging fruit on the tax tree.\n\nAs they go to the polls this year, the middle class should remember Sutton\u2019s Law.", "keywords": ["sanders", "plan", "pay", "bernie", "rates", "states", "united", "class", "income", "raise", "taxes", "middle", "incomes", "tax"], "articleHTML": "<h1>Why Bernie Sanders Has to Raise Taxes on the Middle Class</h1><h2>Asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton quipped, \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d</h2><div><p>Willie Sutton was one of&#160;the most infamous bank robbers in American history.

Bernie Sanders was ahead of the game, having never read anything about supply and demand at all. Unencumbered by basic economics, he was able to see that Big Oil \"gouging\" and Wall Street \"speculators\" were to blame.\n\nRemarkably, right around the time of the fracking revolution, the price of oil and gas started tumbling. I guess Wall Street's heart grew three sizes that day.\n\nBut Sanders didn't have the only theory. One super smart billionaire figured out that Saudi Arabia was the real problem:\n\nLook at what\u2019s going on with your gasoline prices. They\u2019re going to go to $5, $6, $7 and we don\u2019t have anybody in Washington that calls OPEC and says, \"Fellas, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re not going to do it anymore.\"\n\nWhen Donald Trump diagnosed this problem in 2011, his solution wasn't just to \"call Saudi Arabia\" and tell them \"you're not going to raise that f***ing price!\" No, he had a practical measure: seize Iraq's oil fields. \"To the victor belong the spoils. You go in. You win the war and you take it.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering this mass hysteria, although the situation today is somewhat different. The price of oil is below $30 a barrel. The International Energy Agency has warned that the world is now \"drowning\" in oil.\n\nThis week, the price for a particularly low-quality type of oil briefly dipped to negative fifty cents a barrel. That is, producers actually had to pay the refinery to take their oil. Has greed been abolished from the land? Maybe. But there's also a sensible explanation: the high-sulfur oil is expensive to transport and refine, but the producers still had to get rid of it somehow.\n\nBut just a few years ago, it would have been almost unthinkable for refineries to actively discourage oil production. At $140 a barrel, almost any kind of oil is worth refining. And here's the upshot: it was precisely those high prices that prompted the massive investment in production, exploration, and innovation that led to fracking, the shale revolution, and today's tumbling prices. It was greedy, profit-seeking oil companies who drove the price of oil down over 80% from its peak in 2008.\n\nIt's important to grasp these lessons now, because at some point, the price of oil \u2014 or some other commodity \u2014 will rise again, and we will be greeted by the same parade of doomsayers, conspiracy theorists, and would-be regulators that we endured for the last decade.\n\nThey're not gone, they're not even hiding \u2014 they're leading the race for president.\n\nBonus economics of gas story: On Monday, local news in Michigan reported that a bidding war between a couple of gas stations briefly resulted in prices below 50 cents a gallon. To understand just how weird this is, the wholesale price of gasoline is about $1.\n\nIs this another sign of irrational generosity sweeping the petroleum industry? No. Gasoline is retailed at razor thin margins; gas is typically about 70% of a station's revenue, but only 30% of its profit. Gas stations actually make most of their money selling food, cigarettes, and bottled water inside.\n\nOccasionally, gasoline is used as a loss leader: stations will sell gas for cheap (even at a loss) to bring people to the pump, where they can then make more money selling high-margin items like bottled drinks and tobacco.", "keywords": ["sanders", "gasoline", "stations", "supply", "oil", "going", "ago", "gas", "demand", "prices", "theyre", "price", "trump"], "articleHTML": "<h1>What Trump and Sanders Said about Oil Prices 4 Years Ago</h1><h2>\"Forget what you may have read about the laws of supply and demand.\"</h2><div><p>Remember&#160;when complaining about the price of gas&#160;was all the rage?

You&#8217;re not going to do it anymore.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Donald Trump diagnosed this problem in 2011, his solution wasn't just&#160;to \"call Saudi Arabia\" and tell them \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVH4z5Aazw\">you're not going to raise that f***ing price!</a>\"&#160;No, he had a practical measure: <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/04/donald-trumps-solution-on-gas-prices-get-tough-with-saudi-arabia-seize-oil-fields-in-libya-and-iraq.html\">seize Iraq's oil fields</a>.&#160;\"To the victor belong the spoils. You go in. You win the war and you take it.\"</p>\n<p>It's worth remembering this mass hysteria, although&#160;the situation today&#160;is <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/21/where-have-all-the-peak-oilers-gone\">somewhat different</a>. The price of oil is below&#160;$30 a barrel. The International Energy Agency&#160;has warned that the world is now \"drowning\" in oil.</p>\n<p>This&#160;week,&#160;the price for a&#160;particularly low-quality type of oil briefly dipped to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/the-north-dakota-crude-oil-that-s-worth-less-than-nothing\">negative&#160;fifty cents a barrel</a>. That is, producers actually had to&#160;pay&#160;the refinery&#160;to take their&#160;oil. Has greed been abolished from the land? Maybe. But there's also a sensible&#160;explanation: the high-sulfur oil is expensive to transport and refine, but&#160;the&#160;producers still&#160;had to get rid of it somehow.</p>\n<p>But just a few years ago, it would have been almost unthinkable&#160;for refineries to actively discourage oil production. At $140 a barrel, almost any kind of oil is worth refining.&#160;And here's the upshot: it was precisely&#160;those high prices that prompted the massive investment in production, exploration, and&#160;innovation that led to fracking, the&#160;shale revolution, and today's tumbling prices. It was greedy, profit-seeking oil companies who&#160;drove the price of oil down over 80% from its peak in 2008.</p>\n<p>It's important to grasp these lessons now, because at some point, the price of oil&#160;&#8212; or some other commodity &#8212;&#160;will rise&#160;again, and we will be greeted by the same parade of doomsayers, conspiracy theorists, and would-be&#160;regulators&#160;that we endured for the last&#160;decade.</p>\n<p>They're not gone, they're not even hiding&#160;&#8212; they're leading the race&#160;for president.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus economics of gas story</strong>: On&#160;Monday, <a href=\"http://fox4kc.com/2016/01/18/price-war-send-gas-well-below-1-per-gallon-in-michigan/\">local news in Michigan</a> reported that a bidding war between&#160;a couple of gas stations briefly resulted in prices&#160;below 50 cents a gallon.

Both offer important and practical advice for a better life. Brooks\u2019 point is that thinking about our death will refocus our priorities and invest us in the things that matter to a happy, satisfying, and productive life:\n\nParadoxically, this meditation on death is intended as a key to better living. It makes disciples aware of the transitory nature of their own physical lives and stimulates a realignment between momentary desires and existential goals. In other words, it makes one ask, \u201cAm I making the right use of my scarce and precious life?\u201d\n\nBeing Mortal is not so much about death as about dying \u2014 specifically, the long, protracted decline in health and abilities that increasingly precedes the average person\u2019s demise in the West.\n\nGawande wants people to grapple not just with the end but with life before death. If you live long enough, there is much that will go wrong that is both inevitable and irreversible. Just consider our head:\n\nIn the course of a normal lifetime, the muscles of the jaw lose about 40 percent of their mass and the bones of the mandible lose about 20 percent, becoming porous and weak. ... By age sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all. ... Even our brains shrink: at the age of thirty, the brain is a three-pound organ that barely fits inside the skull; by our seventies, gray-matter loss leaves almost an inch of spare room. That\u2019s why elderly people ... are so much more prone to cerebral bleeding after a blow to the head \u2014 the brain actually rattles around inside. The earliest portions to shrink are generally the frontal lobes, which govern judgment and planning, and the hippocampus, where memory is organized... By age eighty-five, working memory and judgment are sufficiently impaired that 40 percent of us have textbook dementia. ... Hair grows gray ... simply because we run out of the pigment cells that give hair its color. The natural life cycle of the scalp's pigment cells is just a few years. We rely on stem cells under the surface to migrate in and replace them. Gradually, however, the stem-cell reservoir is used up. By the age of fifty, as a result, half of the average person\u2019s hairs have gone gray. ... The eyes go for different reasons. The lens is made of crystalline proteins that are tremendously durable, but they change chemically in ways that diminish their elasticity over time \u2014 hence the farsightedness most people develop beginning in their fourth decade. The process also gradually yellows the lens. Even without cataracts ... the amount of light reaching the retina of a healthy sixty-year-old is one third that of a twenty-year-old.\n\nYour joints, skeleton, heart, muscles, veins, and arteries will all gradually soften, harden, swell, or shrink in ways that degrade their function.\n\nGawande wants us to stop deceiving ourselves with the endless parade of feel-good anecdotes about 90-year-old marathon runners and stories about lab mice that promise that science is about to magic up a pill or a genetic potion that will save us from this kind of decline. He quotes an expert on aging that there is \u201cno single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process. \u2026 We just fall apart.\u201d\n\nFalling apart has consequences for how we live during old age. Gawande praises geriatric medicine as crucially important, but also points out that most of what the elderly need isn\u2019t medical intervention. They need to carefully manage life on the decline. Falling \u2014 metaphorically and literally \u2014 can have devastating consequences for our quality of life in the last decade or more.\n\nGawande is particularly critical of the institutions that have been set up to care for the aged and infirm \u2014 nursing homes. Their failures are partly a result of people\u2019s own unwillingness to acknowledge what\u2019s coming and to plan for it. But their problems also derive from how the institution itself evolved.\n\nNursing homes, by his telling, were never primarily designed to help solve old people\u2019s problems \u2014 to help them continue to live their lives and pursue their goals with more limited abilities. Rather, they arose to solve other problems created by a large population of elderly people that increasingly did not live out their final years with children.\n\nAbuse and terrible conditions in poorhouses led many states to try to force their closure in the early and mid-20th century. This, combined with an explosion of hospital construction across the country in the 1950s, led to many former inmates of poorhouses being offloaded onto hospitals. Overcrowding caused administrators to set up special wards for elderly patients with chronic, non-emergency problems; thus \u201cnursing homes\u201d were born.\n\nThis did solve the states\u2019 and the hospitals\u2019 problem of \u201cwhat to do with\u201d old people. But, even though safety conditions and quality at nursing homes have hugely improved since their initial creation, it\u2019s never satisfied the elderly themselves. And given that their wishes and desires were never the ultimate point, that\u2019s not surprising.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t imply the nursing staff are bad people \u2014 on the contrary, they are usually exceptionally dedicated. But however benevolent, the goals of the institution are fundamentally different from the goals of the individuals who reside in it \u2014 and the institution always wins in the end. This inevitably leads to conflict and unhappiness for adults who find their desires are no longer what matters most \u2014 who, for the first time in several decades, find they lack the ability to live a self-directed life.\n\nGawande tells the story of a woman who, after several falls, refused to relocate to the intensive nursing floor of her home. Finally, another fall snapped her femur, and she was left with no choice but to move upstairs.\n\nAll privacy and control were gone. She was put in hospital clothes most of the time. She woke when they told her, bathed and dressed when they told her, ate when they told her. She lived with whomever they said she had to. \u2026 She felt incarcerated, like she was in prison for being old.\n\nThis feeling was not mere hyperbole.\n\nThe sociologist Erving Goffman noted the likeness between prisons and nursing homes half a century ago in his book Asylums. They were, along with military training camps, orphanages, and mental hospitals, \u201ctotal institutions\u201d \u2014 places largely cut off from wider society. \u201cA basic social arrangement in modern society is that the individual tends to sleep, play, and work in different places, with different co-participants, under different authorities, and without an over-all rational plan,\u201d he wrote. By contrast, total institutions break down the barriers separating our spheres of life in specific ways that he enumerated: First, all aspects of life are conducted in the same place and under the same central authority. Second, each phase of the member\u2019s daily activity is carried on in the immediate company of a large batch of others, all of whom are treated alike and required to do the same thing together. Third, all phases of the day\u2019s activities are tightly scheduled, with one activity leading at a prearranged time into the next, the whole sequence of activities being imposed from above by a system of explicit formal rulings and a body of officials. Finally, the various enforced activities are brought together into a single plan purportedly designed to fulfill the official aims of the institution. In a nursing home, the official aim of the institution is caring, but the idea of caring that had evolved didn\u2019t bear any meaningful resemblance to what [she] would call living. She was hardly alone in feeling this way.\n\nCaring is not enough. Being assiduously \u201ccared for\u201d is not what is good about life; it\u2019s just passively treading water until you wear out.\n\nI once met an eighty-nine-year-old woman who had, of her own volition, checked herself into a Boston nursing home. ... \u201cI fell twice in one week, and I told my daughter I don\u2019t belong at home anymore,\u201d she said. She picked the facility herself. It had excellent ratings and nice staff, and her daughter lived nearby. She had moved in the month before I met her. She told me that she was glad to be in a safe place \u2014 if there\u2019s anything a decent nursing home is built for, it is safety. But she was unhappy. The trouble was that she expected more from life than safety. \u201cI know I can\u2019t do what I used to,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this feels like a hospital, not a home.\u201d It is a near-universal reality. Nursing home priorities are matters like avoiding bedsores and maintaining residents\u2019 weight \u2014 important medical goals, to be sure, but they are means, not ends. The woman had left an airy apartment she furnished herself for a small beige hospital-like room with a stranger for a roommate. Her belongings were stripped down to what she could fit into the one cupboard and shelf they gave her. Basic matters, like when she went to bed, woke up, dressed, and ate, were subject to the rigid schedule of institutional life. She couldn\u2019t have her own furniture or a cocktail before dinner, because it wasn\u2019t safe.\n\nSafety is important. But, as Gawande points out, safety is a means to our ends, not a goal in itself. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for personal fulfillment.\n\nThe nursing home is an experiment with centrally planned society \u2014 a well-intentioned, watchful, and above all safe society, but one that is missing most of what we love about adult life: To have an open-ended day, to be spontaneous, to try new things, to choose our friends, to set and pursue goals, to create value and contribute, to have private time, and especially to act without permission.\n\nAt some point, we forget what life was like as a child \u2014 we scoff about surly kids, ungrateful that everything is being done for them \u2014 and overlook why we were desperate to escape the cocoon of dependency and authority that shaped our early lives.\n\nTo have our desires respected as meaningful by others, to make our own choices, was the first intoxicating high of freedom. There\u2019s something uniquely horrible about doing this in reverse \u2014 experiencing independence for six decades, and then having it taken away \u2014 because there is no possibility of ever getting it back.\n\nThis isn\u2019t some sinister plot, of course. Many old people really shouldn\u2019t drive or control their own finances, and in the end, most of us will be flatly unable to perform the basic tasks we have done ourselves since childhood. But that doesn\u2019t make the prospect of losing our autonomy any less tragic.\n\nBrooks recommends practicing the \u201clast year test,\u201d evaluating our choices by imagining that this is our last year on earth. Contemplating the end is a wonderfully clarifying exercise because it encourages us to focus on the things that matter, before we are no longer able to do them.\n\nFew of us are really in our last year; most can confidently expect to live into our seventies or beyond. But that doesn\u2019t blunt the point. When we contemplate our mortality, we should consider that there is quite a bit that we won't be able to do while we are still alive. We have less time than we think, because we will all lose much of our freedom and independence before we lose our lives.\n\nHow we handle that \u2014 how we plan or fail to plan for our own infirmity and loss of control \u2014 will make a huge difference to our happiness in the end. How well we absorb the lessons of life before death will make a huge difference to the health of our society and its ability encourage human flourishing.", "keywords": ["plan", "live", "told", "nursing", "education", "foundation", "death", "institution", "life", "society", "goals", "economic", "homes"], "articleHTML": "<h1>Foundation for Economic Education</h1><h2>We have less time than we think, because we will all lose our freedom and independence before we lose our lives.</h2><div><p>Reading Arthur Brooks&#8217;&#160;New York Times&#160;article&#160;&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/opinion/sunday/to-be-happier-start-thinking-more-about-your-death.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBrooks%2C%20Arthur%20C&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">To Be Happier, Start Thinking More About Your Death</a>&#8221; prompted me to pick up my copy of&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JCW0BCY?tag=foundationforeco\">Being Mortal</a>&#160;by Atul Gawande again.</p>\n<p>I recommend both the article and the book.

Their failures are partly a result of people&#8217;s own unwillingness to acknowledge what&#8217;s coming and to plan for it. But their problems&#160;also derive from how the institution itself evolved.</p>\n<p>Nursing homes, by his telling, were never primarily designed to help solve old people&#8217;s problems&#160;&#8212; to help them continue to live their lives and pursue their goals&#160;with&#160;more&#160;limited abilities. Rather, they arose&#160;to solve&#160;other&#160;problems created by a large population of elderly people that increasingly did not live out&#160;their final years with children.</p>\n<p>Abuse and terrible conditions in poorhouses led many states to try to force their closure in the early and mid-20th century. This, combined with&#160;an explosion of hospital construction across the country in the 1950s,&#160;led&#160;to many former&#160;inmates of poorhouses&#160;being offloaded onto hospitals. Overcrowding caused administrators to&#160;set up special wards for elderly patients with chronic, non-emergency problems; thus &#8220;nursing homes&#8221; were born.</p>\n<p>This did solve the states&#8217; and the hospitals&#8217; problem of &#8220;what to do with&#8221; old people. But, even though safety conditions and quality at nursing homes have hugely improved since their initial&#160;creation, it&#8217;s never satisfied the elderly themselves. And given that their wishes and desires were never the ultimate point, that&#8217;s not surprising.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t imply the nursing staff are bad people &#8212; on the contrary, they are usually exceptionally dedicated. But however benevolent, the goals of the institution are fundamentally different from the goals of the individuals who reside in it &#8212; and the institution always wins in the end. This inevitably leads to conflict and unhappiness for adults who find their desires are no longer what matters most &#8212; who, for the first time in several decades, find they lack the ability to live a self-directed life.</p>\n<p>Gawande tells the story of a woman who, after several falls, refused to relocate to the intensive nursing floor of her home. Finally, another fall snapped her femur, and she was left with no choice but to move upstairs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All privacy and control were gone. She was put in hospital clothes most of the time. She woke when they told her, bathed and dressed when they told her, ate when they told her. She lived with whomever they said she had to. &#8230; She felt incarcerated, like she was in prison for being old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This feeling was not mere hyperbole.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sociologist Erving Goffman noted the likeness between prisons and nursing homes half a century ago in his book&#160;Asylums. They were, along with military training camps, orphanages, and mental hospitals, &#8220;total institutions&#8221; &#8212; places largely cut off from wider society.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A basic social arrangement in modern society is that the individual tends to sleep, play, and work in different places, with different co-participants, under different authorities, and without an over-all rational plan,&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n<p>By contrast, total institutions break down the barriers separating our spheres of life in specific ways that he enumerated:</p>\n<p>First, all aspects of life are conducted in the same place and under the same central authority.</p>\n<p>Second, each phase of the member&#8217;s daily activity is carried on in the immediate company of a large batch of others, all of whom are treated alike and required to do the same thing together.</p>\n<p>Third, all phases of the day&#8217;s activities are tightly scheduled, with one activity leading at a prearranged time into the next, the whole sequence of activities being imposed from above by a system of explicit formal rulings and a body of officials.</p>\n<p>Finally, the various enforced activities are brought together into a single plan purportedly designed to fulfill the official aims of the institution.</p>\n<p>In a nursing home, the official aim of the institution is caring, but the idea of caring that had evolved didn&#8217;t bear any meaningful resemblance to what [she] would call living. She was hardly alone in feeling this way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caring is not enough. Being assiduously &#8220;cared for&#8221; is not what is good about life; it&#8217;s just passively treading water until you wear out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I once met an eighty-nine-year-old woman who had, of her own volition, checked herself into a Boston nursing home. ... &#8220;I fell twice in one week, and I told my daughter I don&#8217;t belong at home anymore,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>She picked the facility herself. It had excellent ratings and nice staff, and her daughter lived nearby. She had moved in the month before I met her. She told me that she was glad to be in a safe place &#8212; if there&#8217;s anything a decent nursing home is built for, it is safety. But she was unhappy.</p>\n<p>The trouble was that she expected more from life than safety. &#8220;I know I can&#8217;t do what I used to,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but this feels like a hospital, not a home.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is a near-universal reality. Nursing home priorities are matters like avoiding bedsores and maintaining residents&#8217; weight &#8212; important medical goals, to be sure, but they are means, not ends.</p>\n<p>The woman had left an airy apartment she furnished herself for a small beige hospital-like room with a stranger for a roommate. Her belongings were stripped down to what she could fit into the one cupboard and shelf they gave her.</p>\n<p>Basic matters, like when she went to bed, woke up, dressed, and ate, were subject to the rigid schedule of institutional life. She couldn&#8217;t have her own furniture or a cocktail before dinner, because it wasn&#8217;t safe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Safety is important. But, as Gawande points out, safety is a means to our ends, not a goal in itself. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for personal fulfillment.</p>\n<p>The nursing home is an experiment with centrally planned society &#8212; a well-intentioned, watchful, and above all safe society, but one that is missing most of what we love about adult life: To have an open-ended day, to be spontaneous, to try new things, to choose our friends, to set and pursue goals, to create value and contribute, to have private time, and especially to act without permission.</p>\n<p>At some point, we forget what life was like as a child &#8212; we scoff about surly kids, ungrateful that everything is being done for them &#8212; and overlook why we were desperate to escape the cocoon of dependency and authority that shaped our early lives.</p>\n<p>To have our desires respected as meaningful by others, to make our own choices, was the first intoxicating high of freedom. There&#8217;s something uniquely horrible about doing this in reverse &#8212; experiencing independence for six decades, and then having it taken away &#8212; because there is no possibility of ever getting it back.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t some sinister plot, of course. Many old people really shouldn&#8217;t drive or control their own finances, and in the end, most of us will be flatly unable to perform the basic tasks we have done ourselves since childhood. But that doesn&#8217;t make the prospect of losing our autonomy any less tragic.</p>\n<p>Brooks recommends practicing the &#8220;last year test,&#8221; evaluating our choices by imagining that this is our last year on earth. Contemplating the end is a wonderfully clarifying exercise because it encourages us to focus on the things that matter, before we are no longer able to do them.</p>\n<p>Few of us are really in our last year; most can confidently expect to live into our seventies&#160;or beyond. But that doesn&#8217;t blunt the point. When we contemplate our mortality, we should consider that there is quite a bit&#160;that we won't&#160;be able to do while we are still alive. We have less time than we think, because we will all lose much of our freedom and independence before we lose our lives.</p>\n<p>How we handle that &#8212; how we plan or fail to plan for our own infirmity and loss of control &#8212; will make a huge difference to our happiness in the end. How well we absorb&#160;the lessons of life before death will make a huge difference to the&#160;health of our society and its ability encourage human flourishing.</p>\n</div>"}]
